    <p>Hello world.  This blog should have started four months ago, but alas.  Instead I waited until I was on an airplane headed back to good ol' Amurika and reflecting upon these past months while enjoying an Oreo Milka Chocolate Bar.<br/>
Mostly this was started after a desire to appear that I actually understood how to use GitHub, but clearly I epically failed.  So instead, this has become a means for me to reflect upon my past months in Budapest.  Last night, I was out with my Hungarian friend Mihaly who asked what I would miss most when I left Budapest and on the flip side, he wanted to know what I missed about my life in America when I was living in Budapest.  My answer for both was the people.  So let's reflect on the people I met in Budapest.  If you are reading this, there is a good chance that you are an American, and you were probably one of the people I missed in Hungary.</p>

<p>One of my first days in Hungary, when I was terrified and probably looked like a Deer in the Headlights with my large Jansport Backpack and Levi's Jeans, I had a particularly memorable interaction with a Hungarian on the public transit.  Mind you, Budapest has particularly good public transit, especially compared to anything in the states (especially Orange County), so I was clearly a little too overeager to be riding the brand new 4-6 train that Budapest had opened in August.  Putting this aside, I was sitting by myself on the train on my way to school.  Suddenly, a man approached me.  I am almost positive that I had an alarmed look on my face and frantically started speaking to him in Englsih trying to persuade him that he was talking to the wrong person.  "I don't know any Hungarian," I said, "I'm new here!!"  Nevertheless, he opens up the satchel he is carrying and whips out a huge bag of grapes.  He takes off a huge hunk of them and hands them to me.  I continue on with my stunned, headlights deer appearance, but this man proceeds to chuckle and pat me on the back and say something which (I think) had to do with drinking nice wine.  Then he exited the 4-6 and left me pondering over what had just happened.  Anyhow, this was among my first insights into Hungarian life.</p>

<p>TO BE CONTINUED.</p>
