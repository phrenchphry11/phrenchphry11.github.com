So this is approximately two weeks late, but I have a few New Year's resolutions that can only be made official by my blogging about them.
Here they are:
<ul>
<li>Give up soda</li>
<li>Get a compass and a map of Northfield and explore Northfield</li>
<li>Become friends with whomever put the tree in the Sevy elevator</li>
<li>Contribute to an open-source project</li>
<li>Find the Carleton tunnels</li>
</ul>
I feel like me justifying these would be too boring for you, O Reader, but at least now since these are written down, I'll have more incentive to complete them.
