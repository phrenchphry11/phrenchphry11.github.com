I'm Holly French, a rising senior computer science major at <a href="http://www.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a>, a small liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota.  I also spent some time my Junior year in Budapest, Hungary, where I spent four months studying math and computer science at <a href="http://www.ait-budapest.com">AIT-Budapest</a>.  Though beyond the academic experience, I had a lot of fun traveling, eating too much food (see my picture), sitting at cafes, going to concerts, doing hackathons, and subway surfing.  But the reason for this blog?  I'm returning to Budapest to work at a wonderful company called <a href="http://www.prezi.com">Prezi</a>.  

When I'm not computering (which admittedly takes up a lot of my time), I like to read, play the piano, do ballet, attempt crosswords, and play bridge (often at <a href="http://www.bridgebase.com">Bridge Base Online</a>). 

You can contact me by <a href="mailto:hollyafrench90@gmail.com">email</a>, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/phrenchphry11">Twitter</a>, or write me a letter or postcard via snail mail (I do love letters!) at: </br>
Holly French </br>
Carleton College </br>
300 North College Street </br>
Northfield, MN 55057

Though this is not my Hungarian address (evidently) so wait to use this address until I am back at Carleton.

Also, if you want to play bridge with me, my Bridge Base username is "hollya."  You definitely should!!
