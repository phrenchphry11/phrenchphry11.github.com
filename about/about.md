I'm Holly French, a junior computer science major at <a href="http://www.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a>, a small liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota.  I also just returned from Budapest, Hungary, where I spent four months studying math and computer science at <a href="http://www.ait-budapest.com">AIT-Budapest</a>.  Though beyond the academic experience, I had a lot of fun traveling, eating too much food (see my picture), going to concerts, doing hackathons, and train surfing.

When I'm not computering (which admittedly takes up a lot of my time), I like to read, play the piano, do ballet, attempt crosswords, and play bridge (see <a href="http://www.bridgebase.com">Bridge Base Online</a>). 

You can contact me by <a href="mailto:hollyafrench90@gmail.com">email</a>, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/phrenchphry11">Twitter</a>, or write me a letter or postcard via snail mail (I do love letters!) at: </br>

Carleton College </br>

Also, if you want to play bridge with me, my Bridge Base username is "hollya."  You definitely should!!
